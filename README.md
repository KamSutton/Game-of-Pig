# Game-of-Pig
This program simulates the dice game Pig, where a human and a computer take turns rolling a die to reach 100 points. Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points. The human chooses to roll or hold, while the computer rolls until it reaches 20 points or rolls a 1. The game is managed using humanTurn() and computerTurn() functions.
